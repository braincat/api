# Structurizr API

This GitHub repository is a simple implementation of the Structurizr API, which is designed to be run on-premises to support Structurizr's [on-premises API feature](https://structurizr.com/help/on-premises-api). It supports the two basic operations required to ```GET``` and ```PUT``` workspaces, with workspace definitions being stored on the file system. From a technical perspective, this implementation is a simple Java EE web application that can be run on a server such as Apache Tomcat, Jetty, etc.
